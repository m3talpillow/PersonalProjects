**Overview:**  
Used THREE.js to build scene and objects, as well as camera controls, and Dat.Gui to build an interactable menu. A composer is used for two styles of shading which shades the entire scene. Created a custom shader through GLSL to mimic Lambert shader.    

**Notes:**  
The Torus Knot can be modified in many different ways and scene shaders can be applied over material shaders.
